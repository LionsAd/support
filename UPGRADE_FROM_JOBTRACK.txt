This module was formerly known as "jobtrack", but was renamed due to a possible
trademark infrigmenet: http://drupal.org/node/469210

If you are upgrading from 'jobtrack' to 'support', you need to follow these
directions.  If you are installing 'support' for the first time, then you
can ignore the contents of this file.

-----

1) Make a backup of your database.
   Play it safe!  Something may go wrong with the upgrade process, and this way
   you don't risk permantently losing important data.

2) Verify that your backup is valid.
   A backup is worthless if it doesn't work.  Test that you can restore your
   backup onto a development server.

3) Disable the 'jobtrack' module.
   The jobtrack module is no longer necessary.

4) Enable the 'support' module.
   The support module replaces the jobtrack module.

That's all, folks!
