If you are upgrading from 'jobtrack' to 'support', you need to follow these
directions.  If you are installing 'support' for the first time, then you
can ignore the contents of this file.

-----

1) Make a backup of your database.
   Play it safe!  Something may go wrong with the upgrade process, and this way
   you don't risk permantently losing important data.

2) Verify that your backup is valid.
   A backup is worthless if it doesn't work.  Test that you can restore your
   backup onto a development server.

3) Upgrade to jobtrack-6.x-1.6-rc1, the final JobTrack release.  This is a 
   mandatory step!  If you are running an older version of JobTrack and attempt
   to upgrade to the Support module things WILL break.  Be sure to run
   update.php after installing jobtrack-6.x-1.6-rc1.

   The final jobtrack release, 6.x-1.6-rc1, can be found here:
     http://drupal.org/node/468726

4) Disable the 'jobtrack' module (be sure you completed step #3 first).
   The jobtrack module is no longer necessary.

5) Enable the 'support' module.
   The support module replaces the jobtrack module.  When you enable the
   module, it will automatically your tickets from jobtrack-6.x-1.6-rc1 to the
   latest version of the support module.
